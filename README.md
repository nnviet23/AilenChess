# AilenChess ‚ôüÔ∏èüëΩ

**AilenChess** is a project born out of passion for chess and admiration for **GM Witty Alien**, who officially retired on **September 6**. Inspired by his journey, the **WintrChess club**, and platforms like **Wintrchess.com**, **Chess.com**, and **NextChessMove.com**, this project aims to create a unique chess analysis web experience with a touch of sci-fi and glitchy aesthetics.

This project is not only about building another chess interface. It is about crafting a space that feels different ‚Äî a tribute to a player and a community that shaped many memorable moments. With **AilenChess**, the goal is to blend the analytical strength of engines like **Stockfish** with a modern, visually striking design that feels alive and immersive.

From a technical perspective, the project is structured with a **frontend written in React and Next.js**, responsible for the user interface, pages, and layouts. The **backend is powered by Node.js and Express**, handling the integration with the chess engine, analysis features, and APIs. The stack was deliberately chosen to strengthen both frontend and backend development skills, since the project also serves as a **learning journey** into building full-stack applications from scratch.

While the inspiration is deeply personal, the motivation is educational: to explore how ideas can turn into functioning tools, how design can transform user experience, and how code can connect passion with creativity.

In the end, **AilenChess** is both a tribute and a classroom ‚Äî honoring the past while opening new paths for growth and exploration.

# GOODBYE WITTY!!!
